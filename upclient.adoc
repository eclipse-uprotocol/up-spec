== Overview

uPClient library is the application facing library that uEs use to communicate to a given implementation of uProtocol (ex. up-android, up-zenoh, etc...). The library contains a transport specific implementation of the link:up-l1/README.adoc[uTransport], and link:up-l2/rpcclient.adoc[RpcClient] interfaces declared in link:languages.adoc[uProtocol Language Specific Library Specifications]. The library also includes implementation specific client-side implementations of the core uServices uDiscovery, uTwin, and uSubscription.

== Requirements

* *MUST* implement the uProtocol uP-L1 & uP-L2 protocol specific interfaces link:up-l1/README.adoc[uTransport], and link:up-l2/rpcclient.adoc[RpcClient]
* *MUST* implement (client-side) uProtocol uP-L3 core uService interfaces link:up-l3/usubscription/v3/README.adoc[uSubscription], link:up-l3/utwin/v3/README.adoc[uTwin], and link:up-l3/udiscovery/v3/README.adoc[uDiscovery]
* *MUST* Follow the naming convention `up-client-[IMPLEMENTATION]-[LANGUAGE]` 

== Class Diagram
