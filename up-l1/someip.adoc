== Overview

Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP *(SOME/IP)* is a communication protocol used in the automotive industry for exchanging data between electronic control units (ECUs) in a vehicle.

SOME/IP provides a framework for efficient and reliable communication between ECUs over IP networks. It is designed to support real-time and high-bandwidth communication requirements in automotive systems. The protocol allows ECUs to discover and communicate with each other, exchange messages, and provide services in a distributed system.

SOME/IP is based on the Internet Protocol (IP) and uses UDP or TCP as the transport layer. It supports various communication patterns, including unicast, multicast, and broadcast. The protocol defines a set of message formats and procedures for encoding and decoding data, handling service discovery, and managing communication sessions.
By using SOME/IP, automotive ECUs can communicate with each other to exchange information related to vehicle functions, such as sensor data, control commands, diagnostics, and software updates. It enables the integration and interoperability of different ECUs from various automotive suppliers within a vehicle's network architecture.
Overall, SOME/IP plays a crucial role in facilitating efficient and standardized communication between ECUs in modern automotive systems.

The following specification will elaborate on how uProtocol shall be mapped to SOME/IP protocol so that mechatronics applications and services can be connected to non-mechatronics and cloud based applications and services.

=== Open Source Libraries

As of the time of writing, there are two open source projects that are available for SOME/IP:

1. *https://github.com/COVESA/vsomeip[COVESA-vsomeip]:* C++ solution based on the original specifications developed by BMW prior to contribution to AUTOSAR
2. *https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.sommr[Eclipse-SommR]:*  Rust implementation based on the latest AUTOSAR SOME/IP specifications.

NOTE: Given the latest version of SOME/IP specifications from AUTOSAR is not open source, we cannot share or implement uProtocol using Eclipse-SommR.

=== AUTOSAR References
All references below to:

- `[PRS_SOMEIP_XXXXX]` refer to link:https://some-ip.com/standards.shtml[AUTOSAR SOME/IP specification].
- `[PRS_SOMEIP_SD_XXXXX]` refer to link:https://some-ip.com/standards.shtml[SOME/IP Service Discovery Protocol Specification].

A search engine usually finds the correct document based on the reference number.

== Transport Layer Translation

link:./README.adoc#utransport[Transport layer (uP-L1)] specifies how link:../basics/umessage.adoc[uMessages] are sent and received over a "wire" between *uEs* or between devices. In this section we will cover the SOME/IP communication protocol binding and event mapping.

Mapping of uTransport APIs to SOME/IP specific library *APIs* shall not be covered in this document given there are multiple open source libraries available for SOME/IP.

Although some limitations of *vsomeip* library are mentioned bellow as *NOTES*.

=== UUris
link:../basics/uri.adoc[`UUri`] is translated to SOME/IP attributes per <<uri-mapping>> table below.

.UUri Mapping
[[uri-mapping]]
[cols="10%m,30%m,60%a",width="100%",options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| UUri Portion | SOME/IP Field | Description

| authority_name | IP:port
| * IP address & port (destination endpoint) of the mDevice.

NOTE: *vsomeip* hides IP endpoint information and uses `ServiceID`/`InstanceID` instead. +
*SHOULD* be left blank or mapped via static transport configuration.

| ue_id | InstanceID\|ServiceID
|
* `ServiceID` *MUST* be encoded in the lower 16 bits of the 32 bit `ue_id`.
* `InstanceID` *MAY* be encoded in the upper 16 bits of `ue_id`.
* If the upper 16 bits are `0x0000` (a reserved instance value), `InstanceID` is assumed to be `1`.
* Explicitly setting `InstanceID` to `0x0001` *SHOULD* be avoided as it increases uProtocol message size.

| ue_version_major | Interface Version
|
* `Interface Version` field of *SOME/IP Header*. `[PRS_SOMEIP_00053]`.
* Maps to `Major Version` for the `ServiceID`.
* If set, it *SHOULD* be passed to underlying SOME/IP library to override it's default _Service Major Version_

| resource_id | MethodID/EventID |
* Identifier of the method/event placed in the lower 16 bits of the *SOME/IP Header* `MessageID`. `[PRS_SOMEIP_00034]`
|===

NOTES::
* `ServiceID` and `MethodID` are defined in *SOME/IP Header format*, specified by AUTOSAR `[PRS_SOMEIP_00030]`.
* `EventID` is an alias for `MethodID`, but used for events. `[PRS_SOMEIP_00245]`
* `InstanceID` is defined in *SOME/IP-SD Service Entry Type*, specified by AUTOSAR `[PRS_SOMEIPSD_00268]`.
* `InstanceID` is not present in *SOME/IP Header*, but is needed for _Service Discovery_ and events and *MUST* be provided for SOME/IP libraries (e.g. `vsomeip`). `[PRS_SOMEIP_00162]`
* Additional mappings *MAY* be required by the underlying SOME/IP library, e.g. Service Major/Minor version. Such values *MAY* be pre-configured

=== UAttributes

The following sections highlight the mapping of link:../basics/uattributes.adoc[uAttributes] to *SOME/IP* fields.

==== Common UMessage Attributes

.Common UMessage Attributes
[[common-umessage-attributes]]
[cols="1m,4a", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| UMessage | SOME/IP Mapping

| id | UUid to SOME/IP `MessageID` as explained in <<uuid-mapping,UUIds>>.

| priority | Not available in SOME/IP.

* A `NOTIFICATION` *MAY* use the default priority.
* A `RESPONSE` *SHOULD* use the `REQUEST` priority.

| ttl | Should be checked for incoming `UMESSAGE_TYPE_REQUEST` messages.

* SOME/IP `REQUEST` *SHOULD* not be sent if incoming UMessage has `ttl > 0` and timestamp from `id` + `ttl` has already expired un *UE* host.
* If present `ttl` *SHOULD* be used to limit the time a `Request` is kept in the cache for correlation with a `RESPONSE`.
* If needed `ttl=0` *MAY* be used to indicate `REQUEST_NO_RETURN` (currently not allowed)

NOTE: Unix timestamps between hosts are very likely to be different (even with `ntp`, especially for cloud events), so the transport *MAY* assume the local timestamp of receiving the request, especially for `ttl < 100ms`.

| payload_format | SOME/IP specification however does not have an equivalent field for link:../basics/upayloadformat.adoc[UPayloadFormat].

It is assumed that the payload is serialized in the format that the other end knows how to deserialize (i.e. it is fixed per topic). As such, when converting between uProtocol and SOME/IP, the `payload_format` field *SHOULD* be ignored (left at the default or `UPAYLOAD_FORMAT_UNSPECIFIED`).
|===

[[uuid-mapping]]
==== UUIDs

link:../basics/uuid.adoc[uProtocol UUID] specifications create a unique identifier for each message along with timestamp information.

The *UUid* is used for correlate between request and response as well. SOME/IP instead defines the `RequestID` as 16 bit `ClientID` + 16 bit `SessionID` (that is incremented). `[PRS_SOMEIP_00046]`

* When messages are converted *SOME/IP* to/from *uProtocol*, care must be taken to ensure that the SOME/IP Response `RequestID` and uProtocol `UUID` are properly mapped, especially when corelating a request to a response.

* Generated SOME/IP Events *MUST* set the 16 bit `ClientID` to 0 per `[PRS_SOMEIP_00925]`
* Generated SOME/IP Responses *MUST* auto-populate the `RequestID` cached from the request message, into the response message and then flush the entry in the cache.

Further details of the usage of IDs for the various message types is described <<umessagetype-mapping,below>>.

==== Message Type

<<umessagetype-mapping>> table below maps of uProtocol messages to `[PRS_SOMEIP_00055]` SOME/IP message types.

.UMessageType Mapping
[[umessagetype-mapping]]
[cols="1m,1m,2a", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| UMessageType | SOME/IP Type | Details

| UMESSAGE_TYPE_PUBLISH | NOTIFICATION | Publish SOME/IP Events.
| UMESSAGE_TYPE_NOTIFICATION | n/a | Same as SOME/IP `NOTIFICATION`.
| UMESSAGE_TYPE_REQUEST | REQUEST | RPC Request
| UMESSAGE_TYPE_RESPONSE | RESPONSE or ERROR | RPC Response or Error has occurred while attempting to deliver the message.
|===

* When receiving *uProtocol* initiated requests:

** *MUST* cache the request `UAttributes` for a maximum of `ttl` so that it can be used to build a response `UAttributes` when receiving a response from SOME/IP.

  response.priority = request.priority
  response.reqid = request.id

** *MUST* clean up the cache after the `ttl` has expired and send an Error `UMESSAGE_TYPE_RESPONSE`
** *MUST* ignore incoming SOME/IP Response(s) for an expired Request.

* When sending auto-generated SOME/IP *REQUEST* messages:

  ** *MUST* cache the message's `RequestID` to correlate with the RESPONSE message.
  ** Underlying SOME/IP library *MAY* handle `RequestID` updating automatically.

* When receiving a SOME/IP initiated requests:

  ** *MUST* cache the SOME/IP `RequestID` as well as the generated `UAttributes` for the request messages so that the response can be translated back to a SOME/IP _RESPONSE_ message


==== Sink & Source Mapping

*uAttributes* Specification explains that `source` attributes defines the address of whom sent the message, while `sink` defines the destination for the message as described in <<uri-mapping>>.

|===

NOTES::
 * [[note-1]] ^(1)^ Maps to lower 16 bits of `ue_id`
 * [[note-2]] ^(2)^ Using session handling so value is increased by 1 until max `0xFFFF` and mapped to `UAttributes.id`
 * [[note-3]] ^(3)^ `source.ue_version_major` missing!
 * [[note-4]] ^(4)^ `ClientID` for vsomeip transport *SHOULD* be set via configuration to `source.ue_id`. It *MUST* be unique for the network.
 * [[note-5]] ^(5)^ `REQUEST_NO_RETURN` is a Request in SOME/IP that applies to `MethodID`, but in uProtocol `NOTIFICATION` applies to events (`resource_id > 0x8000`).


==== Communication Status

<<commstatus-error-mapping>> below provides the mapping of link:../basics/uattributes.adoc[UAttributes] `commstatus` `UCode` codes to SOME/IP error codes `[PRS_SOMEIP_0019]`.

.UCode to SOME/IP Error Code Mapping
[[commstatus-error-mapping]]
[cols="1m,3m", width="75%", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| UCode | SOME/IP Error Codes

| OK | E_OK
| INVALID_ARGUMENT | E_WRONG_MESSAGE_TYPE / E_UNKNOWN_METHOD
| DEADLINE_EXCEEDED | E_TIMEOUT
| NOT_FOUND | E_UNKNOWN_SERVICE
| UNAVAILABLE | E_NOT_READY
| DATA_LOSS | E_MALFORMED_MESSAGE
| INTERNAL | E_NOT_REACHABLE
| UNKNOWN | E_NOT_OK
| FAILED_PRECONDITION | E_WRONG_PROTOCOL_VERSION / E_WRONG_INTERFACE_VERSION

== Application Layer Translation

Application (or message payload) translation is the process of converting *SOME/IP-SD* subscription and discovery messages, to/from *uDiscovery* and *uSubscription* Messages.

=== uSubscription

The following section will elaborate only on the translation of *uSubscription* messages to/from *SOME/IP-SD* messages. Subscription state (persistent or not) is handled in the *uSubscription* services and not at the transport layer or this component.

The following section we will elaborate on how Eventgroup Entry types are mapped to link:../up-l3/usubscription/v3/README.adoc[*uSubscription*] messages for the subscribe
and unsubscribe flows per `[PRS_SOMEIPSD_00385]`.

==== Common Fields

<<common-field-mappings>> table below illustrates the common *SOME/IP-SD* EventGroup Entry fields that are present in for all *SOME/IP-SD* Eventgroup entry types (`SubscribeEventgroup`, `SubscribeEventGroupAck`, `SubscribeEventgroupNack`, `StopSubscribeEventGroup`).

These fields are then mapped to uProtocol `UUri` attributes used in uProtocol `UMessage` for performing subscription operations.

.Common Field Mappings
[[common-field-mappings]]
[cols="1m,2a", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Eventgroup Entry Field | UUri

| ServiceID | Set in lower 16 bits of `ue_id`

| InstanceID a| If instance is not the default (`0x1`), set it in upper 16 bits of `ue_id`

| Major Version a| `ue_version_major`

| EventGroupID / EventID | `resource_id`

NOTE: `1:1` mapping between `EventGroupID` and `EventID` is assumed. +
This may require specific ECU Firmware.


|===

NOTE: `UUri.authority_name` *MAY* be translated to/from IPv4 (and/or IPv6) Endpoint Option of the *SOME/IP-SD* message, although in `vsomeip` this is not available in the API (e.g. each discovered Endpoint maps to `ServiceID`/`InstanceID`/`Major Version`/`Minor Version`).

<<eventgroup-entry-mapping>> table below illustrates the mapping of *SOME/IP-SD* Eventgroup Entry types to *uSubscription* messages for the subscribe and unsubscribe flows.

.EventGroup Entry Type Mapping
[[eventgroup-entry-mapping]]
[cols="1m,1m,2a", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
h| Eventgroup Entry Type h| uSubscription Message h| Additional Details

| `SubscribeEventGroup` | `SubscriptionRequest` | The message is used to subscribe to a topic.

* If `SubscribeAttributes.expire` is not set, `TTL` *MAY* be set to `0xFFFFFF` to indicate that the subscription should remain for the duration of the ignition cycle

NOTE: `vsomeip` has static TTL configuration (for Service Discovery), that applies for all subscriptions. +
It can't be changed per subscription.

| `SubscribeEventGroupAck` | `SubscriptionResponse` | The message is used to acknowledge a successful subscription request.

* `SubscriptionStatus.code` *SHALL* be set to `OK`
* `SubscriptionStatus.state` *SHALL* be set to `SUBSCRIBED`

| `SubscribeEventGroupNack` | `SubscriptionResponse` | The message is used to acknowledge a failed subscription request.

* SubscriptionStatus.code *SHALL* be set to the corresponding error code per the <<commstatus-error-mapping>> table
* SubscriptionStatus.state *SHALL* be set to `UNSUBSCRIBED`

| `StopSubscribeEventGroup` | `UnsubscribeRequest` | The message is used to unsubscribe from a topic.

* `TTL` *SHALL* be set to 0 to indicate that the subscription has terminated.
NOTE: handled by underlying SOME/IP library.

=== uDiscovery Translation

*TODO:* _Pending uDiscovery v3 redesign_
