== Overview

https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a specification hosted by the https://cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation] (CNCF) for describing events in a common way.

The CloudEvents specification defines an envelope for carrying information about the occurrence of a noteworthy event in a system.

.CloudEvents envelope
image::cloudevents.drawio.svg[CloudEvents]

CloudEvents

* are self-contained & unique,
* contain standardized metadata in the header,
* contain optional context information in its data section,
* can be represented using different formats without losing/modifying information.

The metadata contained in an event covers questions like

* What kind of event has occurred?
* When did it occur?
* Where did it occur?
* What context did the event occur in?

Support for using CloudEvents is available for many programming languages by means of corresponding SDKs.

The https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] project has defined a set of *Formats* which describe how events can be expressed using https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md[JSON], https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md[Protobuf] or https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/avro-format.md[Apache Avro].

The accompanying *Bindings* describe how events can be sent via well-known transport protocols like https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md[HTTP], https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/mqtt-protocol-binding.md[MQTT] etc.

== uMessage Mapping

uProtocol uses xref:../basics/umessage.adoc[UMessages] to exchange information between uEntities.
The following sections define the mapping between UMessages and CloudEvents.

=== uAttributes Mapping

The table below defines the mapping of uAttributes to CloudEvent attributes. This mapping *MUST* be used by uProtocol Transport Libraries which use CloudEvents for binding to a particular transport protocol.

[#ce-formats]
=== uPayload Mapping

The sections below define the mapping of uPayload to CloudEvent attributes.

NOTE: The custom `pformat` property is used to indicate the payload type instead of the standard `datacontenttype` property defined by CloudEvents. Its value is set to the integer value assigned to the link:../up-core-api/uprotocol/uattributes.proto[UPayloadFormat]. This helps to reduce the size of the resulting data structure.

==== Mapping to CloudEvent Protobuf Format

The rules defined in https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md[Protobuf Event Format for CloudEvents, Version 1.0.2] MUST be applied when mapping UPayload to CloudEvents using the Protobuf Format. The table below defines specific values to use for the different UMessage payload types.

This mapping *MUST* be used by uProtocol Transport Libraries which use the Protobuf Event Format for the binding to a particular transport protocol.

==== Mapping to CloudEvent JSON Format

The rules defined in https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md[JSON Event Format for CloudEvents, Version 1.0.2] MUST be applied when mapping UPayload to CloudEvents using the JSON Format. The table below defines specific values to use for the different UMessage payload types.

This mapping *MUST* be used by uProtocol Transport Libraries which use the JSON Event Format for the binding to a particular transport protocol.

==== Additional Recommendations

CloudEvents *SHOULD* only be serialized when they are about to be sent via the xref:README.adoc#_utransport[UTransport interface]

The following examples are using the CloudEvent JSON Format.
