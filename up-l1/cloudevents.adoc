== Overview

https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a specification hosted by the https://cncf.io/[Cloud Native Computing Foundation] (CNCF) for describing events in a common way.

The CloudEvents specification defines an envelope for carrying information about the occurrence of a noteworthy event in a system.

.CloudEvents envelope
image::cloudevents.drawio.svg[CloudEvents]

CloudEvents

* are self-contained & unique,
* contain standardized metadata in the header,
* contain optional context information in its data section,
* can be represented using different formats without losing/modifying information.

The metadata contained in an event covers questions like

* What kind of event has occurred?
* When did it occur?
* Where did it occur?
* What context did the event occur in?

Support for using CloudEvents is available for many programming languages by means of corresponding SDKs.

=== Event Format and Transport Binding

The https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] project has defined a set *Formats* which describe how events can be expressed using https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md[JSON], https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md[Protobuf] or https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/avro-format.md[Apache Avro].

The accompanying *Bindings* describe how events can be sent via well-known transport protocols like https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md[HTTP], https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/mqtt-protocol-binding.md[MQTT] etc.


== uMessage Mapping

uProtocol uses link:umessage.adoc[UMessages] to exchange information between uEntities.
The following sections define the mapping between UMessages and CloudEvents.

=== uAttributes Mapping

The table below defines the mapping of uAttributes to CloudEvent attributes.
This mapping MUST be used by link:../upclient.adoc[uProtocol Client Libraries] which use CloudEvents for the binding to a particular transport protocol.

=== uPayload Mapping

The sections below define the mapping of uPayload to CloudEvent attributes.

==== Mapping to CloudEvent Protobuf Format

The rules defined in https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md[Protobuf Event Format for CloudEvents, Version 1.0.2] MUST be applied when mapping UPayload to CloudEvents using the Protobuf Format. The table below defines specific values to use for the different UMessage payload types.

This mapping MUST be used by link:../upclient.adoc[uProtocol Client Libraries] which use the Protobuf Event Format for the binding to a particular transport protocol.

The table below defines specific values to use for the different UMessage payload types.

This mapping MUST be used by link:../upclient.adoc[uProtocol Client Libraries] which use the JSON Event Format for the binding to a particular transport protocol.

==== Additional Recommendations

Data and CloudEvents *SHOULD* only be serialized once when it is to be transported over link:README.adoc#_utransport_interface[UTransport Interface]
