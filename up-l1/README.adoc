The Transport & Session Layer is responsible for bidirectional point-2-point communication between uEntities (uE). 
The purpose of this layer of uProtocol is to define a common API for sending and receiving messages across different transport protocols like Eclipse Zenoh, MQTT 5 or Android Binder, runtime environments like Android, Linux or MCUs, and programming languages like Java, Rust, Python or C/C++.

This specification defines the transport layer's abstract API which is mapped to supported programming languages by means of uProtocol's link:../languages.adoc[language specific libraries]. The API is _implemented_ for particular transport protocols and programming languages by link:../upclient.adoc[uProtocol Client libraries].

The Transport Layer API is defined using UML2 notation.

NOTE: The data types used in the following sections are defined in link:../basics/README.adoc[uProtocol Basic Types].

== UListener

A uEntity registers a `UListener` with the transport in order to process (incoming) messages that are of interest to the uEntity.

=== OnReceive

A transport invokes this method for each newly arrived message that matches the criteria specified as part of <<register-listener,registering the listener>>.

[#send]
=== Send

Clients use this method to transmit a single message.

[source]

send(message: UMessage)
----

.Send Parameters
[width="100%",cols="15%,25%,60%"]
|===
|Parameter | Type | Description

| message
| link:../basics/umessage.adoc[UMessage]
| The message to send.
|===

The successful completion of this method means that the given message has been handed over to the underyling communication protocol's message delivery mechanism. For a hub-and-spoke based communication protocol like MQTT, this typically means that the `send` method implementation has received the MQTT `PUBACK` packet, which indicates that the message has been transferred successfully to the broker from where the message remains to be retrieved by potential recipients. For a peer-to-peer based protocol like HTTP, this typically means that the `send` method implementation has received the peer's HTTP response message, which indicates that the message has been transferred successfully to the peer's HTTP endpoint. Based on that, a client using this method should not assume that the given message has already reached its destination nor that it has already been processed once the method has completed successfully.

On the other hand, unsuccessful completion of this method does not necessarily mean that the given message has not been sent at all. For example, an MQTT based implementation might lose its connection to the MQTT broker _after_ it has sent its MQTT `PUBLISH` packet but _before_ it has received the broker's `PUBACK`. In such a case, clients should use the returned error to determine, if another attempt to send the message is feasible or not. For example, if the initial attempt to send the message has failed with a `UCode.INVALID_ARGUMENT`, then trying to send the same unaltered message again will most likely yield the same result. However, if the initial attempt failed with a `UCode.UNAVAILABLE`, then resending the message using some back-off mechanism will likely succeed eventually.

NOTE: The above strategy for retrying failed attempts to send a message results in https://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/at_least_once_delivery/[at-least-once delivery]. Recipient(s) of these messages should therefore be https://www.cloudcomputingpatterns.org/idempotent_processor/[Idempotent Processors].

In RegisterListener API, we have the source and sink `UUri` in the arguments.
However, not all the combinations of source and sink `UUri` are valid.

The following table are the valid combinations, which maps to the corresponding user case.

[%autowidth]
|===
| source `resource_id` | sink `resource_id` | Publish | Notification | Request | Response | Use Case

| [8000-FFFE] |   None   |    V    |              |         |         | A uE listens for a specific published message 
| [8000-FFFE] |     0    |         |      V       |         |         | A uE listens for a specific notification message
|      0      | [1-7FFF] |         |              |    V    |         | A uE listens for a specific request 
|   [1-7FFF]  |     0    |         |              |         |    V    | A uE listens for a specific response
|     FFFF    |     0    |         |      V       |         |    V    | A uE listens for all notifications and responses 
|     FFFF    |   FFFF   |         |      V       |    V    |    V    | uStreamer listens for all notifications, requests, and responses
|===

Note that other combinations not in the table *MUST* never be used in RegisterListener API.

Sometimes it's necessary to distinguish the message types which should be listened to.
We can get the message types by reorganizing the table above to the following one.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Message Type | Possible resource_id combinations {src_resource_id, sink_resource_id}

| Publish      | {[8000-FFFE], None}
| Notification | {[8000-FFFE], 0}, {FFFF, 0}, {FFFF, FFFF}
| Request      | {0, [1-7FFF]}, {FFFF, FFFF}
| Response     | {[1-7FFF], 0}, (FFFF, 0), {FFFF, FFFF}
|===

[#unregister-listener]
=== UnregisterListener

Clients use this method to unregister a previously registered listener.
After this method has returned successfully, the listener will no longer be invoked for any (matching) messages.

== LocalUriProvider

A uEntity can use the `LocalUriProvider` to create URIs representing the uEntity's local resources during runtime. This information can then be used in messages to be sent to other uEntities.

A `UTransport` implementation can use the `LocalUriProvider` to determine the uEntity's authority during runtime. This information can might be useful for normalizing _local_ URIs passed into the Transport Layer API methods with authority information.

=== GetAuthority

A uEntity invokes this method to get its own authority.

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~utransport-localuriprovider-getauthority~1",oft-needs="dsn"]
--
Implementations *MAY* use any appropriate mechanism to determine the local authority during runtime, e.g. by means of a configuration file, environment variables or a central registry.
--

=== GetSource

A uEntity invokes this method to get the address that it expects incoming Notification or RPC Response messages to be sent to.

[.specitem,oft-sid="dsn~utransport-localuriprovider-getsource-uri-segments~1",oft-needs="impl,utest"]
--
The address returned by an implementation *MUST* consist of the uEntity's (fixed) _authority_, _identifier_ and _major version_ and _resource ID_ `0x0000`.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~utransport-localuriprovider-getsource-runtime~1",oft-needs="dsn"]
--
Implementations *MAY* use any appropriate mechanism to determine these values during runtime, e.g. by means of a configuration file, environment variables or a central registry.
--

=== GetResource

A uEntity invokes this method to get a resource specific address to publish messages to or that it expects incoming RPC Request messages to be sent to.

[.specitem,oft-sid="dsn~utransport-localuriprovider-getresource~1",oft-needs="impl,utest"]
--
The address returned by an implementation *MUST* consist of the uEntity's (fixed) _authority_, _identifier_ and _major version_ and the passed in _resource ID_.
--
  
[.specitem,oft-sid="req~utransport-localuriprovider-getresource-runtime~1",oft-needs="dsn"]
--
Implementations *MAY* use any appropriate mechanism to determine these values during runtime, e.g. by means of a configuration file, environment variables or a central registry.
--

[#delivery-method]
== Message Delivery

[.specitem,oft-sid="dsn~utransport-delivery-methods~1",oft-needs="impl,utest"]
--
* *MUST* support at least one of _push_ or _pull_ delivery methods and *MAY* support both
--
  
[.specitem,oft-sid="req~utransport-delivery-methods-docs~1",oft-needs="uman"]
--
* *MUST* document the delivery methods they support
--


== Communication Protocol Binding

Communication protocols like MQTT, HTTP define a specific Protocol Data Unit (PDU) for conveying control information and user data. A uProtocol Client implements the Transport Layer API defined above on top of such a communication protocol.

A _communication protocol binding_ defines how the uProtocol Transport Layer API maps to the communication protocol's message exchange pattern(s) and how uProtocol messages are mapped to the protocol's PDU. Many communication protocols distinguish between a message's metadata and the (raw) payload. This is often reflected by the structure of the protocol's PDU. For example, HTTP supports _header_ fields and a _body_ which can be used to convey a uProtocol message's attributes and payload respectively.

uProtocol defines bindings to the following communication protocols:

* link:binder.adoc[*Android Binder*]
* link:zenoh.adoc[*Eclipse Zenoh*]
* link:ecal.adoc[*Eclipse ECAL*]
* link:p3comm.adoc[*Eclipse P3Comm*]
* link:mqtt_5.adoc[*MQTT*]
* link:http.adoc[*HTTP*]
* link:someip.adoc[*SOME/IP*]
