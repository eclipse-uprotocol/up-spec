== Overview

Zero Overhead Network Protocol.

Zenoh /zeno/ is a pub/sub/query protocol unifying data in motion, data at rest and computations. It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with geo distributed storage, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.
