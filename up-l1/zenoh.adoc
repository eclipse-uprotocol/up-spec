== Overview

Zero Overhead Network Protocol.

Zenoh /zeno/ is a pub/sub/query protocol unifying data in motion, data at rest and computations. It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with geo distributed storage, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

For more information, please visit https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.zenoh or https://zenoh.io/

== Specifications

=== Zenoh Version

We **MUST** use Zenoh version `1.0.0` to ensure the interoperability in different language bindings.

=== UPTransportZenoh initialization

While initializing up-transport library, we **MUST** include the following information.

* Zenoh Config: If users want to configure how Zenoh works, they can adjust the configuration.
* UUri: The local UUri we are using, and we need this to derive the Zenoh key.

=== UAttribute Mapping

Zenoh supports user attachment.
We **MUST** send additional information with the mechanism, for example, UAttribute.
This reduces the unnecessary serialization on payload, which mostly takes time.

Since the type of user attachment is ZBytes in Zenoh, we **MUST** transform UAttribute into ZBytes.
To keep the flexibility of updating UAttributes in the future, we also reserve 1 byte to represent the version.
Therefore, the format of user attachment will be like following:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| order | value

| 1
| UAttribute version (1 byte)
| 2
| UAttribute object encoded into protobuf
|===

Note that the only supported version now is 0x01.

==== Message Type

There are 4 kinds of message types in uProtocol (publish, notification, request, response), all of said messages are sent using the zenoh `put()` API meaning we shall use the pub/sub infrastructure only of zenoh and not the queryable APIs.


==== Priority Mapping (uProtocol to Zenoh):

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| uProtocol priority | Zenoh Priority

| CS0 | BACKGROUND
| CS1 | DATA_LOW
| CS2 | DATA
| CS3 | DATA_HIGH
| CS4 | INTERACTIVE_LOW
| CS5 | INTERACTIVE_HIGH
| CS6 | REAL_TIME
|===


=== Payload

The data is sent with Zenoh directly without further processing.

=== URI Mapping

UUri are transformed into Zenoh key expressions following the format defined below.
The format of Zenoh key **MUST** be 
`up/[source.authority_name]/[source.ue_id]/[source.ue_version_major]/[source.resource_id]/[sink.authority_name]/[sink.ue_id]/[sink.ue_version_major]/[sink.resource_id]`

* `up/`: Zenoh key **MUST** always start with `up/`, which can be used to identify the uProtocol traffic.
* `authority_name`: The authority_name defined in link:../basics/uri.adoc#3-mapping-to-uri[URI spec] is mapped into Zenoh key directly.
If the authority_name is omitted in UUri, it **MUST** be filled with UAuthority which is initialized while creating UPClienZenoh.
* `ue_id`, `ue_version_major` and `resource_id`: They **MUST** be mapped to the upper-case base16 encoding.

Note that in Publish use case, there is no sink UURI.
We **MUST** use `{}` to replace the empty `authority_name`, `ue_id`, `ue_version_major`, and `resource_id`.

Take some examples:
