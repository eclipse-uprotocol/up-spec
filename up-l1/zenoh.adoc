== Overview

Zero Overhead Network Protocol.

Zenoh /zeno/ is a pub/sub/query protocol unifying data in motion, data at rest and computations. It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with geo distributed storage, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

== Specifications

=== UAttribute Mapping

Zenoh supports user attachment.
We **MUST** send additional information with the mechanism, for example, UAttribute.
This reduces the unnecessary serialization on payload, which mostly takes time.

User attachment supports non-unique key-value pairs, which means one key can include several values.
In this case, the order of the values matters.
To decrease the network overhead, we **MUST** keep the key empty and put the value in the order according to the following table.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| order | value

| 1
| UAttribute version (1 byte)
| 2
| UAttribute object encoded into protobuf
|===

We use 1 byte to represent the UAttribute version.
The version field will keep the flexibility of updating UAttribute in the future.
Now the version is always 0x01.

==== Message Type

There are 3 kinds of message types in uProtocol (publish, request, response).
Different message types **MUST** use different Zenoh API.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| uProtocol message type | Zenoh API

| publish | put
| request | get (query)
| response | reply (queryable)
|===

==== Priority Mapping (uProtocol to Zenoh):

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| uProtocol priority | Zenoh Priority

| CS0 | BACKGROUND
| CS1 | DATA_LOW
| CS2 | DATA
| CS3 | DATA_HIGH
| CS4 | INTERACTIVE_LOW
| CS5 | INTERACTIVE_HIGH
| CS6 | REAL_TIME
|===

=== URI Mapping

UUri **MUST** be able to be serialized into link:../basics/uri.adoc#42-micro-uris[micro form].
Then we can transform the micro-form UUri, which is `u8` array, into string in lowercase hexadecimal representation.

Zenoh key for uProtocol consists of three parts and they are separated by `/`.
Zenoh key **MUST** start with `upl/` or `upr/`.
While the local UUri maps to `upl/`, the remote UUri maps to `upr/`.
If UAuthority is defined in UUri, it **MUST** be put in the second part.
Then the rest of the UUri **MUST** be put in the last part.

To be more specific:

* The local UUri without UAuthority: `upl/[hexadecimal representation of the UUri]`
* The remote UUri with UAuthority: `upr/[hexadecimal representation of the UAuthority]/[hexadecimal representation of the rest of the UUri]`

Note that there is a special case. If the UUri only contains UAuthority with empty UEntity and UResource,
it's defined as a special form of Zenoh key `upr/[byte hexadecimal of UAuthority]/**`.
It can listen to all the messages sending to a certain UAuthority.

Some examples:

* The local UUri without UAuthority:

[source]
----
UUri {
  authority: empty,
  entity: UEntity {
    name: "body.access",
    version_major: 1,
    id: 1234,
  }
  resource: UResource {
    name: "door",
    instance: "front_left",
    message: "Door",
    id: 5678,
  }
}
----

It's a local UUri, so it starts with `upl`.
Also, we leave the second part blank since it doesn't have UAuthority.
Only ID in UEntity and UResource matters while serializing into link:../basics/uri.adoc#421-local-micro-uri[micro-form Uri].
Then transform it into lowercase hexadecimal representation.
The Zenoh key is `upl/0100162e04d20100`.

* The remote UUri with UAuthority

[source]
----
UUri {
  authority: UAuthority {
    name: UAuthName,
    number: Id({01, 02, 03, 10, 11, 12})
  },
  entity: empty,
  resource: empty,
}
----

It's a remote UUri, so it starts with `upr`.
The UAuthority is serialized into mirco form.
Given how a UAuthority containing an ID is serialized into micro form as outlined in link:../basics/uri.adoc#422-remote-micro-uris[the spec],
it is length + serialized UUri in lowercase hexadecimal representation, which is `06` + `0102030a0b0c`.
The UEntity and UResource are all blank, so it is the special form UUri.
It means that the third part is `+++**+++`.
Therefore, the Zenoh key is `upr/060102030a0b0c/+++**+++`.

=== UPayload

Although UPayload can be encoded into protobuf, it saves a lot of time without encoding.
UPayload consists of three parts: length, format, data.

* Length only works with shared memory, and we ignore it temporarily.
* Format **SHOULD** be sent with Zenoh encoding. Zenoh supports `Encoding::WithSuffix`. The encoding here is `KnownEncoding::AppCustom` and the UPayloadFormat (int32) is transformed into the string.

[source, rust]
----
Encoding::WithSuffix(
    KnownEncoding::AppCustom,
    payload.format.value().to_string().into(),
)
----

* Zenoh takes data as a buffer simply and sends it directly. Ignore the shared memory (reference) temporarily.
