== Overview

https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a CNCF specification for describing events in a common way. We will use CloudEvents to formulate all kinds of uProtocol messages that will be sent to and from uEs.

.CloudEvents
image::cloudevents.drawio.svg[CloudEvents]

CloudEvents are:

* An envelope for information about the occurrence of change in a system, it has a "from" address (source) with the "to" address is optional (sink)
* carry facts in metadata with standard attributes
* Self-contained & unique (you don't need to attach data to an event)
* Can be encoded/decoded into different formats without losing/modifying information

Cloud Events answers the following in the metadata:

* What kind of event?--> *type*
* When was it sent? --> *time*
* Who sent it? -->**source**
* What is the event unique identifier? --> *id*
* What is the shape of the data event? --> *dataschema*
* What is the event data? --> *data*

The specification is transport agnostic (can run over HTTP, MQTT, AMQP, NATS, Kafka), and comes with SDK in most common languages.

=== CloudEvent Format vs Data Format

CloudEvents can be represented as objects (in the programming language of choice) as well as serialized to any binary or text encoding formats such as protobuf, JSON, AVRO, XML, etc.... CloudEvent are often referred to as "the envelope for data" as it holds the data and metadata.

https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] has defined a set of specifications for the well know formats (ex. https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md[JSON], https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md[Protobuf], etc..) as well as how to send these messages over well-known transports (ex. https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md[HTTP], https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/mqtt-protocol-binding.md[MQTT], etc..).

NOTE: Additional formats and transports not covered by https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents.io] shall be covered in link:../up-l1/README.adoc[uP-L1 Specifications]

== Data (Payload)

Data portion of the CE contains the application layer (uP-L2) message also known as the link:README.adoc#_upayload[UPayload]. 


== CloudEvent Format
In this section we will explain the format (encoding) for CloudEvent message and the impacts on the payload formats.


.Formats

|===
|CE Format |Encoding |Data Format Considerations

|https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md[*Protobuf*]
|Binary
a|* *MUST* adhere to the https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md[Protobuf Event Format for CloudEvents - Version 1.0.2] specifications

If link:README.adoc#_upayload[UPayload] is a protobuf message:

* *MUST* be packed as google.protobuf.Any and stored in field proto_data
* *MUST NOT* set datacontenttype to "application/x-protobuf"
* *MUST NOT* set dataschema to the URI of the protobuf message, this is optional as this information is already stored in the google.protobuf.Any

If the link:/README.adoc#_upayload[UPayload] is binary and _NOT_ a protobuf message:

* *MUST* be stored in the field binary_data
* *MUST* set datacontenttype to "application/octet-stream"
* *MAY* set dataschema to the URI-Reference schema of the data

|https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md[*JSON*]
|Text
a|* *MUST* adhere to https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md[JSON Event Format for CloudEvents - Version 1.0.2] specifications

If link:README.adoc#_upayload[UPayload] is a protobuf message:

* *MUST* be packed as google.protobuf.Any and stored in field data_base64 attribute,
* *MUST NOT* set datacontenttype to "application/x-protobuf"
* *MUST NOT* set dataschema to the URI of the protobuf message, this is optional as this information is already stored in the google.protobuf.Any

If link:README.adoc#_upayload[UPayload] is binary and _NOT_ a protobuf message:

* *MUST* be base64 encoded and stored in data_base64 attribute
* *MUST* set datacontenttype to "application/octet-stream"
* *MAY* set dataschema to the URI-Reference schema of the data

|===


The following are additional recommendations when implementing the protocol:

* Data and CE *SHOULD* only be serialized once when it is to be transported over link:README.adoc#_utransport_interface[UTransport Interface]

The following examples are using the JSON CE format
