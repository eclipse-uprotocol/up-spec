Built into the protocol will be a mechanism to version different parts of the protocol and system. Since different components need to be versioned by different mechanisms and at different frequency, we will discuss the types in this section.

== Format

* Versioning *MUST* follow https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] definitions with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

=== MAJOR

The `MAJOR` part of an artifact's version

* *MUST* be `1` for its initial release

* *MUST* be incremented when the artifact is being changed in a not backwards compatible way

=== MINOR

The `MINOR` part of an artifact's version

* *MUST* be incremented when artifact is being changed in a backwards compatible way

Backwards compatibility is baked into the protobuf specifications and as such updating the service proto file should only force an update to the MINOR

== What Must be Versioned

=== Messages

xref:../up-l2/README.adoc[uP-L2 Messages] *MUST* contain a version such that the serialization and deserialization between devices of said message can be done.

=== uEs

Interfaces for uEs are declared in proto files. Protobuf builds in backwards and forwards compatibility support into the IDL so a server and client may be updated independently of each other without breaking the communication or serialization/deserialization of generated code.

If the uE declares an interface in proto:
* *MUST* have their `MAJOR.MINOR` version values specified (declared) inside their proto file per xref:../up-l3/README.adoc[uP-L3 Specifications]


=== Distribution

_Section removed as this is implementation specific and not part of the protocol_
