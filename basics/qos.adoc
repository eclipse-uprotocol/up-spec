uProtocol allows messages to be exchanged between uEntities on the same and/or different devices. The network bandwidth and/or CPU cycles available for performing this task may be limited, though. uProtocol therefore supports priority based message processing at the link:../up-l1/README.adoc[Transport] and link:../up-l2/README.adoc[Communication Layer] based on https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4594[RFC4594 - Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes].

For this purpose, each link:umessage.adoc[UMessage] is assigned to one of the following service classes:

.QoS Classifications
[width="100%",cols="8%,49%,43%",options="header",]
|===
|Class |Description |Typical Use Case

|*CS0* |Low Priority. No bandwidth assurance |File Transfer
|*CS1* |Standard, undifferentiated application |General (unclassified)
|*CS2* |Operations, Administration, and Management |Streamer messages (sub, connect, etcâ€¦)
|*CS3* |Multimedia streaming |Video Streaming
|*CS4* |Real-time interactive |High priority (RPC events)
|*CS5* |Important |Signaling
|*CS6* |Safety Critical |Network control
|===

These classes are represented by the values of the link:../up-core-api/uprotocol/v1/uattributes.proto[UPriority protobuf enum].

* A UMessage *MAY* be assigned _explicitly_ to a service class by setting its `attributes.priority` property to the desired value.
[#default-priority]
* A UMessage *MUST* be considered to belong to class `CS1`, if its priority is not set explicitly.
* Every topic *MUST* have a priority code associated with it.
* link:../upclient.adoc[uProtocol Client Libraries] *SHOULD* map the message's service class to a corresponding mechanism of the underlying transport protocol, if available.
* link:../up-l2/dispatchers/README.adoc[uProtocol Dispatchers] *SHOULD* consider the message's service class as part of their message scheduling strategy.
