uProtocol allows messages to be exchanged between uEntities on the same and/or different devices. The network bandwidth and/or CPU cycles available for performing this task may be limited, though. uProtocol therefore supports priority based message processing at the xref:../up-l1/README.adoc[Transport] and xref:../up-l2/README.adoc[Communication Layer] based on https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4594[RFC4594 - Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes].

For this purpose, each xref:umessage.adoc[UMessage] is assigned to one of the following service classes:

.QoS Classifications
[cols="1,4,3"]
|===
|Class |Description |Typical Use Case

|*CS0* |Low Priority. No bandwidth assurance |File Transfer
|*CS1* |Standard, undifferentiated application |General (unclassified)
|*CS2* |Operations, Administration, and Management |Streamer messages (sub, connect, etcâ€¦)
|*CS3* |Multimedia streaming |Video Streaming
|*CS4* |Real-time interactive |High priority (RPC events)
|*CS5* |Important |Signaling
|*CS6* |Safety Critical |Network control
|===

These classes are represented by the values of the link:../up-core-api/uprotocol/v1/uattributes.proto[UPriority protobuf enum].

[#default-priority]
* A UMessage *MAY* be assigned _explicitly_ to a service class by setting the message's xref:uattributes.adoc#common-attributes[`priority`] property to the desired value. If the property is not set, the UMessage belongs to class `CS1` by default.
* link:../upclient.adoc[uProtocol Client Libraries] *SHOULD* map the message's service class to a corresponding mechanism of the underlying transport protocol, if available.
