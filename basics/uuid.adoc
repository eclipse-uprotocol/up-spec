== Overview
Universal Unique Identifiers (UUID) are used in uProtocol to uniquely identify link:umessage.adoc[`UMessages`]. The UUID includes a timestamp used to verify the liveliness of a message (ex. if a type of message should expire or not).  For more explanation of the use cases for the uProtocol UUID, please refer to link:uattributes.adoc[UAttributes Specifications].
