== Overview 

UMessage is the top-level message type for the uProtocol. It consists of link:uattributes.adoc[message metadata] and (optional) link:upayload.adoc[payload]. UMessage is the common way to represent messages sent between uEntities over any communication protocol/middleware.

NOTE: Please refer to link:../up-core-api/uprotocol/umessage.proto[umessage.proto] for more details.
