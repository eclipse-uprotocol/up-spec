== Overview 

UAttributes contain metadata describing a particular message's purpose, content and processing requirements.

NOTE: Please refer to link:../up-core-api/uprotocol/v1/uattributes.proto[uattributes.proto] for the latest version of the UAttributes data model.

uProtocol defines four types of messages:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Type |Description

|Publish
|A message that is used to notify all interested consumers about an event that has occurred.

|Notification
|A message that is used to inform a specific consumer about an event that has occurred.

|RPC Request
|A message that is used by a service consumer to invoke one of a service provider's methods with some input data, expecting the service provider to reply with a response message.

|RPC Response
|A message that is used by a service provider to send the outcome of processing a request message
from a service consumer.
|===

Each type of message is described by a set of mandatory and optional attributes.

[#common-attributes]
== Common Message Attributes

The following table defines attributes that are used for all message types:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Name |Type |Mandatory |Description

|`id`
|link:uuid.adoc[UUID]
|yes
|A unique message identifier. The timestamp contained in the UUID is used as the message's creation time.

|`priority`
|link:qos.adoc[UPriority]
|no
|The QoS level that this message should be processed/delivered with. If not specified explicitly, the link:qos.adoc#default-priority[default priority level] is assumed.

|`ttl`
|`unsigned integer`
|no
a|The amount of time (in milliseconds) after which this message *MUST* no longer be delivered/processed. The message is considered expired if this attribute is set to a positive value and

stem:[t_{current} > t_{id} + ttl]

|`traceparent`
|https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/#traceparent-header[W3C Trace Context Level 3, traceparent]
|no
|A tracing identifier to use for correlating messages across the system. Intended to be compatible with https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/extensions/distributed-tracing.md[CloudEvents distributed tracing extension].

|`payload format`
|link:upayloadformat.adoc[UPayloadFormat]
|no
|The format of the payload (data).

|===

[#publish-attributes]
== Publish Message Attributes

The following table defines attributes that are used for publish messages in addition to the common attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Attribute |Mandatory |Description

|`type`
|yes
|*MUST* be set to `UMESSAGE_TYPE_PUBLISH`.

|`source`
|yes
a|A link:uri.adoc[UUri] representing the topic that this message is published to.

* The UUri's `resource_id` *MUST* be set to a value in range `[0x8000, 0xFFFE]`.
|===

[#notification-attributes]
== Notification Message Attributes

The following table defines attributes that are used for notification messages in addition to the common attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Attribute |Mandatory |Description

|`type`
|yes
|*MUST* be set to `UMESSAGE_TYPE_NOTIFICATION`.

|`source`
|yes
a|A link:uri.adoc[UUri] representing the component that this notification originates from.

* The UUri's `resource_id` *MUST* be set to a value in range `[0x8000, 0xFFFE]`.

|`sink`
|yes
a|A link:uri.adoc[UUri] representing the receiver of this notification.

* The UUri's `resource_id` *MUST* be set to `0`.

|===

[#request-attributes]
== RPC Request Message Attributes

The following table defines attributes that are used for RPC request messages in addition to the common attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Attribute |Mandatory |Description

|`type`
|yes
|*MUST* be set to `UMESSAGE_TYPE_REQUEST`.

|`source`
|yes
a|The link:uri.adoc[UUri] that the service consumer expects to receive the response message at.

* The UUri's `resource_id` *MUST* be set to `0`.

|`sink`
|yes
a|A link:uri.adoc[UUri] identifying the service provider's method to invoke.

* The UUri's `resource_id` *MUST* be set to a value in range `[1, 0x7FFF]`.

|`priority`
|yes
a|The link:qos.adoc[QoS] level that this message should be processed/delivered with.

* *MUST* be set to `UPRIORITY_CS4` or higher.

|`ttl`
|yes
a|The amount of time (in milliseconds) after which this request message should no longer be delivered to or processed by a service provider.

* *MUST* be set to a value > 0


|`permission_level`
|no
|The service consumer's permission level as defined in link:permissions.adoc#_code_based_access_permissions_caps[Code-Based uE Access Permissions (CAPs)].

|`token`
|no
|The service consumer's access token as defined in link:permissions.adoc#_token_based_access_permissionstaps[Token-Based uE Access Permissions (TAPs)].
|===

[#response-attributes]
== RPC Response Message Attributes

The following table defines attributes that are used for RPC response messages in addition to the common attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Attribute |Mandatory |Description

|`type`
|yes
|*MUST* be set to `UMESSAGE_TYPE_RESPONSE`.

|`source`
|yes
a|The link:uri.adoc[UUri] identifying the method that has been invoked and which this message is the outcome of.

* The UUri's `resource_id` *MUST* be set to a value in range `[1, 0x7FFF]`.

|`sink`
|yes
a|The link:uri.adoc[UUri] that the service consumer expects to receive this response message at.

* The UUri's `resource_id` *MUST* be set to `0`.

|`reqid`
|yes
|The `id` property value of the request message that this is the response to.

|`priority`
|yes
|The link:qos.adoc[QoS] level that this message should be processed/delivered with. *MUST* be the same value as that of the corresponding request message's `priority` attribute.

|`ttl`
|no
|The amount of time after which this response message should no longer be delivered to or processed by the service consumer.

|`commstatus`
|no
|A link:../up-core-api/uprotocol/v1/ustatus.proto[UCode] indicating an error that has occurred during the delivery of either the RPC request or response message. A value of `0` or no value indicates that no communication error has occurred.

|===


== Validation

Each link:../languages.adoc[uProtocol Language Library] *MUST* provide means to assert the consistency of a message's attributes according to its type as defined in the sections above. The concrete implementation should follow common practices of the particular programming language.
