== Overview 

UAttributes contain metadata describing a particular message's purpose, content and processing requirements.

NOTE: Please refer to link:../up-core-api/uprotocol/uattributes.proto[uattributes.proto] for the latest version of the UAttributes data model.

uProtocol defines four types of messages:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Type |Description

|Publish
|A message that is used to notify all interested consumers about an event that has occurred.

|Notification
|A message that is used to inform a specific consumer about an event that has occurred.

|RPC Request
|A message that is used by a service consumer to invoke one of a service provider's methods with some input data, expecting the service provider to reply with a response message.

|RPC Response
|A message that is used by a service provider to send the outcome of processing a request message
from a servcice consumer.
|===

Each type of message is described by a set of mandatory and optional attributes.

[#common-attributes]
== Common Message Attributes

The following table defines attributes that are used for all message types:

[%autowidth]
|===
|Name |Type |Mandatory |Description

|`id`
|link:uuid.adoc[UUID]
|yes
|A unique message identifier. The timestamp contained in the UUID is used as the message's creation time.

|`priority`
|link:qos.adoc[UPriority]
|no
|The QoS level that this message should be processed/delivered with. If not specified explicitly, the link:qos.adoc#default-priority[default priority level] is assumed.

|`ttl`
|`unsigned integer`
|no
|The amount of time (in milliseconds) after which this message MUST no longer be delivered/processed. The message is considered expired if this attribute is set to a positive value and

stem:[t_{current} > t_{id} + ttl]

|`traceparent`
|https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/#traceparent-header[W3C Trace Context Level 3, traceparent]
|no
|A tracing identifier to use for correlating messages across the system. Intended to be compatible with https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/extensions/distributed-tracing.md[CloudEvents distributed tracing extension].
