== Overview

`RpcClient` defines a common, language specific interface for method invocation to allow the auto-generation of client-side & server-side code per-language (SDK) in lieu of per platform. 

.API Definition Terminology
[width="80%",cols="20%,80%"]
|===
|Term | Description

| `IN` | Input parameter
| `OUT`| Output parameter
| `IN/OUT` | Input/output parameter
| `&` | Parameter passed by reference
| `?` | Parameter is optional
| `Future` | Language specific mechanism to access the result of asynchronous operations, ex. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/future[`std::future`] for C++, https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[`CompletableFuture`] for Java, etc...

|===


== Interface

All link:../languages.adoc[language-specific uProtocol libraries] *MUST* declare the `RpcClient` interface with method:

`OUT Future link:../basics/umessage.adoc[UMessage] invokeMethod(IN link:../basics/uri.adoc[UUri], IN UPayload?, IN link:../basics/uattributes.adoc[CallOptions])`

.Parameters
[#parameters, width="80%",cols="30%,70%"]

| Parameter
| Description

| `UUri`
| Method URI that is being invoked

| `CallOptions`
| Set of attributes that can be sent as part of a method invocation

|===


== Implementation

Implementations communicate to their underlining transport through the link:../up-l1/README.adoc#_utransport[uTransport Interface].

* Every link:../upclient.adoc[uPClient library] *MUST* implement the `RpcClient` interface.

* The `UUri` and `CallOptions` passed to `invokeMethod()` *MUST* be cached non-persistent memory per call, this is to be able to complete the `Future` when the response is received from the server.

* The `UPayload` passed to `invokeMethod()` *MAY* be null or empty.

* Method invocation that fails, *MUST* return exceptionally as defined by the link:../basics/error_model.adoc[uProtocol Error Model].

* Cached requests must be completed exceptionally with  `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` when `UAttributes.isExpired()` is `true`. This notifies the calling context that the request has expired.

* *MUST* return `INVALID_PARAMETER` if `UUri` is null or empty or `CallOptions.priority() < CS4`

* *MUST* return `ALREADY_EXISTS` if the same request already exists (i.e. same `UUri` and `CallOptions`). This is to prevent duplicate requests.

* *MUST* complete future successfully when the response is received from the server.
