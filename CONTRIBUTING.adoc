== Best Current Practices (BCPs)

The following section will elaborate on the best practices we (the contributor community) will apply to each repositories in the Eclipse-uProtocol project. 

* Projects that are intended to be used in production *MUST* adhere to BCPs listed below. 

If the project is _not_ intended to be used for production:

* *MUST* clearly labeled in your repos README.adoc as `NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE`



=== Code Contributions
Contribution pull requests *MUST* contain the following:

* *Commit Description:* Properly formatted subject for the commit including a detailed description of the change. the subject line is pulled into the automatic release generation
* *GitHub Issue:* Commits for adding new features/functions *SHOULD* have an associated github issue
* *Documentation:* Interfaces must be properly documented with functional hyperlinks
* *Test Coverage:* Code *MUST* have associated test coverage 

=== Repositories
The following are BCPs for newly created repositories under the Eclipse-uProtocol project:

* GitHub actions *MUST* be used to create CI/CD workflows for validating build, test, and documentation for every pull request for main branch
* "Branch Protection Rules" *MUST* be enabled with the minimal settings below (replace `verify-pr` for the target that runs the build, test, and documentation workflows):

```
branch_protection_rules: [
        orgs.newBranchProtectionRule('main') {
          required_approving_review_count: 1,
          required_status_checks+: [
            "verify-pr"
          ],
        },
      ],
```
* Release *MUST* follow http://semver.org requirements and begin with `v0.1.0-dev`. Each subsequent release will have the `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, and `PATCH` number incremented following semver requirements 

* Initial commit *MUST* include the following legal documents:
** `LICENSE` *MUST* be Apache 2.0 or Eclipse Public License 2.0 (_see why below_)
** `CONTRIBUTING.adoc` *MUST* link to this document
** `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc` *MUST* link to https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc
** `README.adoc` *MUST* Clearly document how to build and use your software
** `SECURITY.adoc` *MUST* link to https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/.github/SECURITY.adoc

* *SHOULD NOT* contain `CONTRIBUTORS.adoc` as the information can be fetched from the git history

If `NOTICE` information cannot be autogenerated:
* *MUST* include `NOTICE.adoc`


=== Why Apache 2.0 and not MIT or BSD?

The Apache 2.0 License and the MIT License are both popular open-source licenses, but they have some differences in terms of their requirements and provisions. Here are the key distinctions:

* *Scope:* The Apache 2.0 License is more comprehensive and covers patents, trademarks, and attribution requirements, while the MIT License is simpler and primarily focuses on copyright.

* *Patent Grant:* The Apache 2.0 License includes a patent grant, which means that it provides explicit permission for users to use any patents held by the licensor. The MIT License does not include a specific patent grant.

* *Redistribution:* Both licenses allow for the redistribution of the software, but the Apache 2.0 License includes specific requirements for preserving notices, disclaimers, and license terms in derivative works.

* *Copyleft:* The MIT License is considered a permissive license, allowing for more flexibility in how the software is used and integrated into other projects. The Apache 2.0 License has some copyleft provisions, requiring modifications and derivative works to be licensed under the same license.

* *Compatibility:* Both licenses are generally considered compatible with other open-source licenses. However, the Apache 2.0 License is more explicitly compatible with the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3, while the MIT License is compatible with a wider range of licenses.
