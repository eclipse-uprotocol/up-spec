== Purpose

A software defined vehicle requires the design and development of software entities that are distributed by nature, deployed in different os/hw environments (mechatronics, high-compute, mobile phones, and the cloud).

Every environment have their own software development, deployment, and communications protocols, thus resulting in no common interface,language or means for said distributed software to seamlessly discover, connect, and communicate with each other in a transparent, simplified, and secure manner.

uProtocol addresses the above-mentioned problem by defining an ubiquitous language that includes:

1. Transport layer interface: Common way to  `send()` and `receive()` messages regardless of the underlining networking transport protocol

2. Common Message Definitions

3. Common application layer interfaces for core business logic (ex. subscription management, discovery, etc...)

<<img-overview>> image below provides a high-level view of what we aim to define in this specification. The arrows between the uEs are the physical/virtual transport (anything from OSI layer 2 protocol up to automotive/Internet application layer protocols, and everything in-between. The icon image:https://cloudevents.io/img/logos/cloudevents-icon-color.png[CloudEvents,25,35] represents the messages sent between uEs that, for the remainder of this document, referred to as CloudEvents or CEs.

== link:basics/README.adoc[The Basics]
In this section of the specifications we cover the foundations of uProtocol such as CloudEvents, UUIDs, naming conventions and more.


== Layers

.uProtocol Layers
[#img-layers]
image::layers.drawio.svg[uProtocol Layers]

uProtocol consists of three layers as depicted in <<img-layers>> above, they are:

1. link:up-l1/[*Transport & Session Layer (uP-L1):*] Bidirectional point-2-point communication between uEs (how messages are sent and received between uEs).

2. link:up-l2/[*Communication (Messaging) Layer (uP-L2):*] Defines the message types, headers, format, and delivery semantics. uProtocol builds upon https://cloudevents.io/[CNCF CloudEvent] specifications as a way to describe the messages in a common way

3. link:up-l3/[*Application Layer (uP-L3):*] Also known as the business logic layer, responsible for declaration and definition of interfaces between clients and servers (ex. subscription management, discovery, etc...)


== Software Entities (uEs)
A uE is software that communicates with other software using uProtocol.

<<img-ues>> below illustrates the set of uProtocol defined uEs required to implement the protocol.

=== Communication Backbone

uEs in this category are essential for dispatching/routing of messages between uEs, uDevices, and uDomains.

=== Core uEs
Core uEs are business layer logic to perform a specific function of the protocol highlighted in the table below.
