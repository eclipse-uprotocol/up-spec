== Overview
Language specific uProtocol libraries (_the library_), builds the protobuf defined data model from https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-core-api[Eclipse-uProtocol Core-API] project and adds validators, serializers, and builders specific to the protocol for said data model not covered in protobuf generated code. The library is also responsible to declare the language specific uP-L1 & uP-L2 interfaces uTransport, RpcClient, and RpcServer. 


NOTE: All projects/libraries *MUST* be released under a permissive license (Apache 2.0, MIT, etc..) and located in https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol[GitHub Eclipse-uProtocol] project and **MUST** also depend only on other permissive license libraries.


== Source 
The following section will shall elaborate on the contents and structure of these libraries.

* The root namespace (package name) *MUST* be `org.eclipse.uprotocol`
* Modules defined in table <<content>> below *MUST* be implemented in their own folder (namespace)
* Each module *SHOULD* separate the implementation of the specification as defined in table <<folders>> below.


.Module Folders/Namespace
[#folders,width="80%",cols="20%,80%",options="header"]
|===
| Folder | Description

| `validators`
| static methods to validate the data model

| `serializer`
| Any code that is responsible to Serialize and deserialize the data model

| `factory` (or `builder`)
| Factory methods to build the data model per business logic (i.e. to build CloudEvents, UUIDs, etc..)

|===


=== Modules

Modules are packages (folders) that reside under the `src` director. <<content>> table below lists the required modules.

.SDK Modules
[#content,width="100%",cols="20%,20%,60%",options="header"]
|===
| Folder | Specification |Description

| `uri`
| link:basics/uri.adoc[UUri]
| How things are addressed in uProtocol

| `uuid`
| link:basics/uuid.adoc[UUID]
| Unique ID & timestamp specification 

| `cloudevents`
| link:up-l1/cloudevents.adoc[CloudEvents]
| Specification of how uProtocol data models can be expressed using CloudEvents data model

| `transport`
| link:up-l1/README.adoc[uTransport]
a| uP-L1 Transport Interface & data model.

* *MUST* declare the interface & data model where as link:../upclient.adoc[uProtocol Client Library] implement the said interface.

| `rpc`
| link:up-l2/rpcclient.adoc[uP-L2 RPC Client] & link:up-l2/rpcserver.adoc[uP-L2 RPC Server]
a|APIs used to invokemethods() (for clients) and register RpcRequest Listeners (servers) to simplify implementation of the RPC design pattern. 

|===


== Test

 * *SHOULD* include a test suite under the folder `test`
 * *MUST* be able to run the test suite such that merge requests (commits) cannot be merged till tests are passed
  * *SHOULD* cover 100% of all code and specifications defined in <<Source>>


== Build

 * *MUST* be easily built in both a Windows and Linux development environment. Any build requirements (i.e. package dependencies) need to be properly documented in the README
* *MUST* be able to be imported to any wellknown IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VSCode, etc..) and include self contained build system to build the code and dependencies(ex. maven, gradle, clang, soong, etc...).
* *MUST* fetch external dependency libraries as handle build dependencies, *MUST NOT* copy external dependencies
* *MUST NOT* depend on external copyright or copyleft libraries/modules, only permissive licenses such as Apache 2.0, MIT, shall be accepted etc..


== Documentation

 * *MUST* include a main README.adoc file that explains how to build and use the library. 
 * Each module *MUST* also have a README.adoc that explains how to use said module
