== Overview 

uProtocol Language specific libraries (_libraries_) are written for a given programming language (ex. Java, C++, etc...) to implement the protocol and are the primary library that is used by applications and services (uEs) to communicate with other uEs. The _libraries_ declare the API for the uProtocol Transport (uP-L1) and Communication Layers (uP-L2) and provide a generic implementation of the latter.


== Requirements

=== Content

A language library

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-transport-api~1",oft-needs="impl",oft-title="Library declares Transport Layer API"]
--
* *MUST* declare the language specific {up-l1-ref}, such that the interface can be implemented by the transport libraries.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-comm-api~1",oft-needs="impl",oft-title="Library declares Communication Layer API"]
--
* *MUST* declare the language specific {up-l2-ref}, such that the interface *MAY* be implemented by the transport libraries.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-comm-api-default-impl~1",oft-needs="impl,utest",oft-title="Library implements Communication Layer API"]
--
* *MUST* provide a default implementation of {up-l2-ref} based on the (abstract) Transport Layer API.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="dsn~up-language-naming~1",oft-title="Library follows naming pattern"]
--
* *MUST* be named according to pattern `up-[LANGUAGE]`, e.g. `up-rust` or `up-python`.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="dsn~up-language-structure~1",oft-title="Library uses uProtocol namespace"]
--
* *MUST* use the programming language specific namespace concept, if availabe, to indicate that the library belongs to the _uProtocol_ project. If the language supports hierarchical namespaces (like Java does), then `org.eclipse.uprotocol` *SHOULD* be used. Otherwise, a namespace of `uprotocol` *MUST* be used.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-documentation~1",oft-needs="uman",oft-title="Library contains adequate README file"]
--
* *MUST* contain a `README` file that explains how to build and use the library.
--

=== Test & CI

A language library

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-test-coverage~1",oft-title="Library has sufficient test coverage"]
--
* *SHOULD* contain a test suite that covers 100% of all code and specifications defined in <<Content>>
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-ci-build~1",oft-needs="impl",oft-title="CI asserts that library can be built"]
--
* *MUST* use a CI workflow that prevents pull requests from being merged if they cannot be built.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-ci-test~1",oft-needs="impl",oft-title="CI asserts that test suite passes"]
--
* *MUST* use a CI workflow that prevents pull requests from being merged if the library's test suite does not pass.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-ci-linter~1",oft-needs="impl",oft-title="CI asserts that code complies with linting rules"]
--
* *MUST* use a CI workflow that prevents pull requests from being merged if the library's source code does not comply with the project's code linting rules.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-ci-api-docs~1",oft-needs="impl",oft-title="CI asserts that code contains API documentation"]
--
* *MUST* use a CI workflow that prevents pull requests from being merged if the library's source code does not contain proper API documentation.
--

=== Build

A language library

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-build-sys~1",oft-needs="impl",oft-title="Library uses common build system"]
--
* *MUST* employ an existing build system that is commonly used for the given programming language.
--

[.specitem,oft-sid="req~up-language-build-deps~1",oft-needs="impl",oft-title="Library build system resolves dependencies"]
--
* *MUST* resolve and include external dependencies as part of the build process only.
--
