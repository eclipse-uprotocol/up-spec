// UUri is used as a method to uniquely identify devices, services, and resources
// on the  network.<br>

// the resources in the service. Defining a common URI for the system allows

// the name of the resource Message type, such as "Door". The Message type matches
// the protobuf service IDL that defines structured data types.
