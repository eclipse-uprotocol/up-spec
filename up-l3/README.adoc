Application layer, also known as the business logic layer, is responsible for declaration interfaces between clients and servers for features and functions, the API layer that defines the methods and topics served by a service.

In this specification we will also define core uProtocol business logic (APIs) such as  subscription management, discovery, and digital twin. These interfaces are _declared once, used everywhere_ so that the mental model for developers is consistent across different heterogeneous systems.

== Architecture Patterns

uProtocol supports the architecture patterns defined in the table below to implement the majority of use cases that could be required for business logic communication between clients and services.

.Architecture Patterns
[width="100%",cols="19%,11%,28%,42%",options="header",]
|===
|Architecture Pattern |Delivery Policy |Description |Requirements

|*RPC* |At-least-once |When uE requires acknowledgement from the receiver  a|
* If the client-side business logic requires retry policy, it *MUST* implement the retry policy
* Server-side business logic *MUST* implement Idempotency for remote procedural calls
* Dispatchers that are unable to deliver req.v1, *MUST* generate a _delivery failure res.v1_ and send it back to the Sender uE

|*Publication* |At-most-once |When uE wishes to publish an CE to multiple consumers (a.k.a. "fire & forget") a|
* Dispatcher *MUST* provide access to CEs that have failed to be delivered (DLT defined in a later section), for both the Sender and/or Receiver uE business logic

|*Notification* |At-most-once |When a uE wishes to notify a specific uE (a.k.a a publication with a destination) |
|===


== Core uProtocol uEs

This special purpose built uEs are required to implement uProtocol and must be present on each uDevice.

|uE |Ver |Description

|*uSubscription*
|link:usubscription/v3/README.adoc[*v3*]
|Subscription management service that is responsible for managing subscriptions between uEs to realize the publisher/subscriber design pattern.

|*uDiscovery*
|link:udiscovery/v3/README.adoc[*v3*]
|Discovery of uThings locally, within a domain, and throughout the network. Supports URI resolution (to find where something is located)

|*uTwin*
|link:uTwin/v1/README.adoc[*v1*]
|Local cache of published events
